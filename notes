# Getting to know your data

## Who is your data?
* I'm going to mix up my parts of speech, but stick with me

## You may think your data is this
* This looks like a bunch of numbers

## But really, it's this
* This is your source

## What does that mean?
* We're reporters. You ask them questions
* You know their bias
	* Who collected this? For what?
	* How sure are they?

## Or more likely, this is your data
* Data is dirty

## Quick bath
* Take a min and max
* Sort and scan
* Take a sum and average (does it work?)
* Are there missing values?

# Change things around
* Text to columns
* Convert to numbers, dates, strings as needed

## Pivot
* Pivot tables are great for analysis, but just as good for cleaning
* If you know sql great, but pivot next best thing
* Get sums by group, see if names are mispelled, if there are more records than you think

## Data smells
* Check previous year's data before working with a new stuff
* Excel row limits, 65,536 before 2007, 1,048,576 after
* Null Island

## Make your life easier
* Don't change the original
* Don't make changes in a cell, create a new column
* Use consistent names that say what it is and what changed
